*fiand.txt*	Plugin for searching in archives outside of your workspace

You can define one or more base directories to search in - and optional
a search string to search in the files

There are lots of solutions to search inside the current working directory,
this plugin provides searching in external directories. This is
useful on java maven projects where all libraries are stored in a repository
directory like '~/.m2'. I couldn't find a plugin to be usable as java type
browser, so this may be a small solution.

Mappings:
	<leader> hh to search for the word under the cursor

Commands:
	:FindInAllArchives {word}
		search in all archives for {word}. if {word} is empty or _NOSEARCH_
		only file names will filtered

							*fiand-settings*
This plugin doesn't have any settings.
