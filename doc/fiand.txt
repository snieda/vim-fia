*fiand.txt*	Plugin for searching in archives outside of your workspace

You can define one or more base directories to search in - and optional
a search string to search in the files

Use:
Hit <leader>hh keys to start the search in all archives. You will be asked
for one or more directories and an optional search string (default: word under
cursor). 
The search may take some seconds. Then a new buffer with the result
will be opened. Each archive file name is followed by the matched lines. You 
are able to click on the line with the archive file (keys: gf) name to open,
browse and edit the files in the archive.

There are lots of solutions to search inside the current working directory,
this plugin provides searching in external directories. This is
useful on java maven projects where all libraries are stored in a repository
directory like '~/.m2'. I couldn't find a plugin to be usable as java type
browser, so this may be a small solution.

Mappings:
	<leader> hh to search for the word under the cursor

Commands:
	:FindInAllArchives {word}
		search in all archives for {word}. if {word} is empty or _NOSEARCH_
		only file names will filtered

							*fiand-settings*
This plugin doesn't have any settings.
